## An overview of the project and its purpose
### For the ETL mini project, you will work with a partner to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After you transform the data, you'll create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, you’ll upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
### Since this is a one-week project, make sure that you have done at least half of your project before the third day of class to stay on track.
### Although you and your partner will divide the work, it’s essential to collaborate and communicate while working on different parts of the project. Be sure to check in with your partner regularly and offer support.

## Instructions on how to use and interact with the project
### Part 1: Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
### Part 2: Create the Campaign DataFrame
### Part 3: Create the Contacts DataFrame
### Part 4: Create the Crowdfunding Database
  
## At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project
- At the beginning everything was fine since most of the 1st part came in the exercises of the class, from the second day of class there were similar codes, when I did not know what to write or did not understand the code, I deepened with BlackBox.ai each part of the code and report.
